            <p style="color:green;">To have a remote access of an android device, the attacker needs to have a persistent R.A.T.(Remote Adminstration Toolkit)first,
                 which provides the attacker basic but also important credentials of the target.
                 The R.A.T. installed in the targets device is known as the 'payload'.
                  The payload is generated in a A.P.K.(Android Package Kit) format which is given the permission to send stages(target data) to the attacker.
                   One of the major probelems faced by penetration testers that this service does not work over the internet,
                    for example: you may get remote access to the device within your home network(wifi) but unable to access the same when target gets out of range.
                 </p>
                 <p style="color:green;">You can resolve the above mentioned probelems with tunneling agents such as best recomended is ngrok.
                 Though it runs for a fixed amount of time but at least provides a successfull connection establishment between the target and the attacker in a free account.
                Other sesrvices are:Portmap.io, cloudflare, packetroit, playit.gg, etc.</p>
